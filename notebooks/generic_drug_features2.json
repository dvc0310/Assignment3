            "Rozlytrek works by targeting ROS1 fusion proteins. Normally, the ROS1 gene makes a protein that can send signals to your cells, telling them to grow. When a normal ROS1 gene breaks apart and attaches to another part of a gene, it can create a ROS1 gene fusion which results in a ROS1 fusion protein. ROS1 fusion proteins continuously send signals that can cause cancer cells to develop, grow, and spread. When Rozlytrek finds ROS1 fusion proteins, it binds to them inside cancer cells, blocking their action and slowing or stopping the cancer from growing. About 2% of people with metastatic NSCLC have abnormal ROS1 genes. Roxlytrek also has activity against NTRK and ALK fusion genes.",

However, when the IDH1 gene is modified due to a genetic mutation, it leads to an abnormal version of the IDH1 protein and other substances such as the oncometabolite, D-2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). Tibsovo decreases levels of 2-HG, reducing blast counts and increasing levels of mature myeloid cells. Blasts are undeveloped bone marrow cells that will later mature into red blood cells, white blood cells, or blood-clotting platelets. They are typically absent in the bloodstream, and their presence signals a bone marrow issue, such as myelodysplastic syndrome."
